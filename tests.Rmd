## Warm up:

* What is a geometric series?
* How is it written?
* When does it converge?

* A p-series is of the form $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{1}{n^p}$
* When does it converge?

* Is the harmonic series a geometric series, p-series, or neither?

## The comparison test

(Theorem 9.4)

Suppose $0 \leq a_n \leq b_n$ for all n beyond a certain value

* If $\sum b_n$ converges, then $\sum a_n$ converges
* If $\sum a_n$ diverges, then $\sum b_n$ diverges

## Examples {.columns-2}

Does the comparison test work with:

* $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{2n-6}{n^4+5}$$
* $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{n+7}{3n^4-2}$$
* $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{2n^4-4}{n^5+7}$$
* $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{2n^4+5}{3n^5-2}$$

## Questions about the limit comparison test

* Why does it work?
* Why "beyond a certain value"?
* Why not just use the integral test?

## Limit comparison test

(Theorem 9.5)

Suppose $a_n>0$ and $b_n>0$ for all $n$. If
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = c \textrm{ where } c>0,$$

then $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ either both converge or both diverge.

Why does this work?

## Examples {.columns-2}

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2n^2-4n+1}{5n^3}$$
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{7n^4-2n}{\sqrt{5n^3}}$$
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{3n^5-6n^2+22}{5n^4-14}$$

## Practice

Write down a series, we'll then trade with neighbors

## Absolute convergence

A series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is said to converge absolutely if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|$ converges
