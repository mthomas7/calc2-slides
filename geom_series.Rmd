## Geometric Sequences

Of the form: $a, ax, ax^2, ax^3, \ldots$

## Geometric Series (finite)

Of the form: $S_n = a+ax+ax^2+ax^3+\ldots+ax^{n-1}$

## Geometric Series (infinite)

Of the form: $S_n = a+ax+ax^2+ax^3+\ldots$

## Alternating signs

## Programming

Write Sage code to create a geometric sequence, then we'll put together a geometric series
