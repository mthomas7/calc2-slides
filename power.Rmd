## Power Series

A power series is defines as a series of the form:

$$C_0 + C_1 (x-a) + C_2 (x-a)^2 + \cdots + C_n (x-a)^n + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty C_n (x-a)^n$$

Note the index on the sum!!!

## What they are

Power series generalize series - the may converge for certain values of $x$ and diverge for other values of $x$
